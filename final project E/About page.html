        <h2>Goal</h2>
     <p>Camping, hiking, and other activities that have to do with the great outdoors are the focus of this website, 
        along with a practical way for people to have fun and have something to look forward to. 
        In addition to offering a wide range of opportunities for people to explore the outdoors and experience something new, 
        we are dedicated to offering unique camping experiences.  

        <h2> Meeting new people</h2>
     <p>No matter what type of camping you do, whether you are in a tent, RV, or cottage,
         there are endless opportunities to make new friends. 
         You can potentially make new friends in new ways when hiking, fishing, and camping involve many people, 
         and since most activities involve lots of people, you are more likely to meet new people during these activities.</p>  
         
         <h2> Indroducting new people</h2>
         Everyone knows someone who has yet to experience the joy of camping. 
         Introducing them to the outdoors can help them discover their love of camping, hiking, and fishing, 
         but if they don't then it's fine too camping isn't for everyone.
